# **2\. Mechanical Structure**

## **2.1 Objective**

Our goal is to use a 6U CubeSat for high-precision marine surveillance. Integrating the MonoScape100 camera into a 6U frame without sacrificing structural integrity is the main mechanical difficulty. At the widest part of the camera, most COTS CubeSat frames cannot accommodate it (see Appendix A), which increases the possibility of insufficient support, vibrations, or misalignment during launch. These problems could lead to mission failure, blurry imagery, and calibration mistakes.
