# Acknowledgements

The Team would like to first and foremost thank our project supervisors and advisors: Mr. Eugene Ee, Prof. Chua Tai Wei, and Prof. Goh Cher Hiang for providing us with suggestions and guidance throughout the semester. Their knowledge, expertise and experience in the relatively complex field of Space Systems and CubeSats have provided us with insightful knowledge, allowing us to improve upon many aspects of our project.

We would also like to thank the other Galassia-5 Subteams for working closely with us and readily providing all required information about the Payloads under their purview, such that we have a clear direction in which to proceed regarding the Mechanical Design requirements of Galassia-5.

Also, we would like to extend our appreciation to our stakeholders and partners, namely:

* Future Systems & Technology Directorate (FSTD) for supporting the mission by granting in-principle funding;  
* Office for Space Technology and Industry, Singapore (OSTIn) for supporting the mission via launch procurement and linkups with industry;  
* ST Engineering Satellite Systems for their agreement to provide environmental testing services at the subsystem and system level;  
* NuSpace and Mr. Ng Zhen Ning for providing their consultancy services as part of their role as the Satellite Bus Contractor.

Finally, we would like to thank Ms. Annie Tan from the DCP Electronics Lab for her suggestions and technical help during the prototyping process, and Mr. Peter Wei for his assistance regarding CNC machining of the Prototype.
